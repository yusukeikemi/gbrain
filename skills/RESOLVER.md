# GBrain Skill Resolver

This is the dispatcher. Skills are the implementation. **Read the skill file before acting.** If two skills could match, read both. They are designed to chain (e.g., ingest then enrich for each entity).

## Always-on (every message)

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Every inbound message (spawn parallel, don't block) | `skills/signal-detector/SKILL.md` |
| Any brain read/write/lookup/citation | `skills/brain-ops/SKILL.md` |

## Brain operations

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "What do we know about", "tell me about", "search for", "who is", "background on", "notes on" | `skills/query/SKILL.md` |
| "Who knows who", "relationship between", "connections", "graph query" | `skills/query/SKILL.md` (use graph-query) |
| Creating/enriching a person or company page | `skills/enrich/SKILL.md` |
| Where does a new file go? Filing rules | `skills/repo-architecture/SKILL.md` |
| "where does this brain page go", "file this in the brain", "brain taxonomist", "taxonomy check", "refile brain page", "which directory does this page go" | `skills/brain-taxonomist/SKILL.md` |
| "EIIRP", "everything in its right place", "store this research", "put this in the brain", "make this re-doable", "DRY this up", "file all of this", "organize all of this work", "archive this research thread" | `skills/eiirp/SKILL.md` |
| Fix broken citations in brain pages | `skills/citation-fixer/SKILL.md` |
| "citation audit", "check citations", "fix citations" | `skills/citation-fixer/SKILL.md` (focused fix). For broader brain health, chain into `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` |
| "Research", "track", "extract from email", "investor updates", "donations" | `skills/data-research/SKILL.md` |
| Share a brain page as a link | `skills/publish/SKILL.md` |
| "validate frontmatter", "check frontmatter", "fix frontmatter", "frontmatter audit", "brain lint" | `skills/frontmatter-guard/SKILL.md` |
| "what search mode", "is my cache hot", "tune my retrieval", "compare search modes", "clear search overrides" | `gbrain search modes/stats/tune` directly. See `skills/conventions/search-modes.md` |
| "eval results", "search benchmark", "haters-immune methodology", "regression check on retrieval" | `gbrain eval run-all` / `gbrain eval compare`. See `docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md` |

## Content & media ingestion

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "capture this", "save this thought", "remember this", "drop this in the inbox", "save to brain" | `skills/capture/SKILL.md` |
| User shares a link, article, tweet, or idea | `skills/idea-ingest/SKILL.md` |
| "watch this video", "process this YouTube link", "ingest this PDF", "save this podcast", "process this book", "summarize this book", "PDF book", "ingest it into my brain", "what's in this screenshot", "check out this repo" | `skills/media-ingest/SKILL.md` |
| Meeting transcript received | `skills/meeting-ingestion/SKILL.md` |
| Generic "ingest this" (auto-routes to above) | `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` |

## Thinking skills (from GStack)

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| "Brainstorm", "I have an idea", "office hours" | GStack: office-hours |
| "Review this plan", "CEO review", "poke holes" | GStack: ceo-review |
| "Debug", "fix", "broken", "investigate" | GStack: investigate |
| "Retro", "what shipped", "retrospective" | GStack: retro |

> These skills come from GStack. If GStack is installed, the agent reads them directly.
> If not, brain-only mode still works (brain skills function without thinking skills).

## Setup & migration

| "Populate links", "extract links", "backfill graph" | `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` (graph population phase) |
| "Populate timeline", "extract timeline entries" | `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` (graph population phase) |

## Identity & access (always-on)

| Trigger | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| Non-owner sends a message | Check `ACCESS_POLICY.md` before responding |
| Agent needs to know its identity/vibe | Read `SOUL.md` |
| Agent needs user context | Read `USER.md` |
| Operational cadence (what to check and when) | Read `HEARTBEAT.md` |

## Disambiguation rules

When multiple skills could match:
1. Prefer the most specific skill (meeting-ingestion over ingest)
2. If the user mentions a URL, route by content type (link → idea-ingest, video → media-ingest)
3. If the user mentions a person/company, check if enrich or query fits better
4. Chaining is explicit in each skill's Phases section
5. When in doubt, ask the user (see `skills/ask-user/SKILL.md` for the choice-gate pattern)

## Conventions (cross-cutting)

These apply to ALL brain-writing skills:
- `skills/conventions/quality.md` — citations, back-links, notability gate
- `skills/conventions/brain-first.md` — check brain before external APIs
- `skills/conventions/brain-routing.md` — which brain (DB) and which source (repo) to target; cross-brain federation is latent-space only
- `skills/conventions/subagent-routing.md` — when to use Minions vs inline work
- `skills/ask-user/SKILL.md` — choice-gate pattern for human input at decision points
- `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md` — where files go
- `skills/_output-rules.md` — output quality standards
