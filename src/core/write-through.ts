/**
 * Shared disk write-through for the canonical ingestion path.
 *
 * After a page row lands in the DB (via importFromContent / putPage), this
 * renders the row to markdown via `serializePageToMarkdown` and writes it to
 * `sync.repo_path` so the brain repo has a committable `.md` artifact that
 * round-trips cleanly through `gbrain sync`. The file is rendered FROM the DB
 * row, so the two sinks cannot diverge.
 *
 * Extracted from the v0.38 `put_page` write-through (operations.ts) so the
 * `put_page` op AND `gbrain brainstorm/lsd --save` share one implementation
 * instead of hand-rolling parallel (and divergent) copies. The extraction also
 * upgraded the write to be ATOMIC — the original used a bare `writeFileSync`
 * into a live git tree that `gbrain sync` / autopilot actively walk, so a crash
 * mid-write left a partial `.md` that sync would fail to parse. We now write to
 * a unique temp sibling and `rename` into place (rename is atomic on the same
 * filesystem), matching the `.tmp + rename` convention used by
 * import-checkpoint.ts / op-checkpoint.ts.
 *
 * Trust gating (subagent sandbox, dry-run) stays at the CALLER — this helper
 * only does "row exists + repo is a real dir → render + atomic write".
