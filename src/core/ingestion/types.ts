/**
 * Ingestion contract — IngestionSource, IngestionEvent, IngestionSourceContext.
 *
 * The locked public API surface for third-party skillpack publishers. Once a
 * skillpack ships against this contract, breaking it requires a major bump and
 * shows up in test/public-exports.test.ts. Treat these types as a versioned
 * public API the same way BrainEngine is.
 *
 * Source contract design decisions (locked in /plan-ceo-review + /plan-eng-review):
 *
 *   - Sources are dumb emitters; daemon owns supervision (SourceSupervisor
 *     mirrors the v0.34.3.0 ChildWorkerSupervisor pattern for in-process
 *     modules — see daemon.ts). Sources THROW exceptions on failure; daemon
 *     catches and applies exponential backoff per the crash-counter rule.
 *
 *   - IngestionEvent.content_type taxonomy drives daemon-side hybrid routing
 *     (E2 eng-review decision): content under 1MB is processed inline before
 *     queue submission; content over 1MB submits a separate process_audio /
 *     process_video Minion handler chain. Sources can opt out per-event by
 *     pre-emitting content_type: 'text/markdown' with already-extracted text.
 *
 *   - IngestionEvent.untrusted_payload flag round-trips to the put_page
 *     handler. Set by the webhook source (network input) and skillpack
 *     sources that fetch URLs. When true, put_page skips auto-link and
 *     applies the slug-allowlist gate. Untrusted in-process callers (CLI
 *     `gbrain capture`) leave it false.
 *
 *   - The api_version constant on the skillpack manifest decouples the
 *     contract from skillpack release cadence. v1 sources fail loudly with a
 *     paste-ready upgrade hint when the daemon loads against contract v2.
